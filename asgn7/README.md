To use the encode decode program, type "make" into the command line to create both encode and decode programs. To run any of them, type "./" followed by encode or decode to run the corresponding program. This can be followed by any of the following flags and input values that you would like to include, which are the same for both programs.

-v to display compression stats
-i <input> to specify input to compress, stdin by default
-o <input> to specify output of compressed input, stdout by default
