The program math displays the table for a specified trig function, sin, cos, tan, or e^x. This program approximates these values using Pade Approximants for sin, cos, and tan, and e^x is approximated using its Taylor series. These values are then compared with the math library (math.h) output of sin, cos, tan, and e^x.These values are then subtracted from each other to see how different the approximants are to the math library.
In order to use the makefile, type make in the command line to make all the necessary files to run math.c. Typing "make clean" removes all unnecessary files after running the program.
